    <h2> About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Pooja Vasanthan. I am currently a rising senior in high school in Texas. I was born in Arizona and moved to Texas when I was in Pre-K. I don't have any siblings, but I do am close to my cousins, who live fairly close to me. My favorite color is blue, and I love to read, play sports, and spend time with my friends and family. I also enjoy traveling, and some of the places I have been to include Florida, Washington, New Mexico, and California. I found interest in both the computer science and health science fields. I hope to acquire more knowledge regarding these fields. One of my goals is to go to college and earn a degree in a field of my choosing. Moreover, I am a dedicated and enthusiastic person. I am always willing to put my best effort and respect those around me!</p>
