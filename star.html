    <p> This is another Scratch project I completed. It is once again in the Scratch block programming language. There are two characters presented in the game. The character in the orange suit provided the instruction for the game, which is that the user will play as the octopus who can shoot stars at invading bats on another planet (besides Earth). If the bats touch the Octopus, the user loses and is sent to Earth. If the user gets all the bats, they win.</p>
