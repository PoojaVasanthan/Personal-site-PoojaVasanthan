    <p> This was one of the projects I did when I was first exposed to computer science. The language is Scratch, a block programming language. I built this game, and essentially it prompts the player to think of a number. Then, the cat character in the game will guess numbers and ask the player if the number they are thinking of is lower or higher than the character guessed. The cat keeps guessing until the player says yes when the guess is correct.</p>
